### What did you think of our pairing session?
It was a good, productive session. When it’s a tough challenge sometimes it’s easy to get lost in one’s thoughts but we didn’t forget to communicate and helped each other’s learning.

### Please tell me some positives from the session!
I enjoyed our session because it didn’t feel like we were rushing just to complete the challenge without solid understanding of it or forcing one’s style to another. (I hope I didn’t force mine!) I liked seeing how differently you work from I do and getting a new perspective. Again I was able to solve the step 3 thanks to your help! Also you’re a respectful pair partner who’s easy to work with and I appreciate it.

### Any areas in which I could improve?
You don’t have to say sorry just because something doesn’t click right away. It happens to all of us and we learn it together. :) It was fun working together, thank you again!

### What did you think of our pairing session?
Overall, was a great session. Shame it was cut short due to the workshop. I look forward to working together again in future.

### Please tell me some positives from the session!
I enjoyed that you proactively initiated a break. I need to get in a habit of taking more of those! Despite coming in a few steps ahead, you were happy to share any things you had figured out and tips. You clearly made an effort not to say or show too much, so that I could learn without being given the answers.

### Any areas in which I could improve?
You are a very humble coder, which is a great quality! My only constructive note would be, lose the subtle self digs, you don't need them! "So and so is really good at this... not like me". The second part to that comment does you no favours. We're all out here learning and you are smashing out projects just like everyone else! Forget about comparisons :D

### What did you think of our pairing session?
I thought our pairing session went well overall!

### Please tell me some positives from the session!
Both of us didn't rush through any concepts covered and went back to previous steps if there was something we struggled with which helped us both solidify our understanding. I think we also worked together well as a team and fed off each other nicely, giving me help on areas I wasn't familiar with and vice-versa, also taking a slow methodical approach which works especially well for the more complex areas in the later steps.

### Any areas in which I could improve?
As mentioned above I think our pairing session went well! I don't believe there's much to improve on at this current point in time as we both did what we could with our current understanding, as our knowledge grows over the course I believe this will lead us to be able to help each other explain and execute more complex concepts which will help enhance our pairing abilities in the future.
