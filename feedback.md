## What did you think of our pairing session?
I thought our pairing session went well overall!

## Please tell me some positives from the session!
Both of us didn't rush through any concepts covered and went back to previous steps if there was something we struggled with which helped us both solidify our understanding. I think we also worked together well as a team and fed off each other nicely, giving me help on areas I wasn't familiar with and vice-versa, also taking a slow methodical approach which works especially well for the more complex areas in the later steps.

## Any areas in which I could improve?
As mentioned above I think our pairing session went well! I don't believe there's much to improve on at this current point in time as we both did what we could with our current understanding, as our knowledge grows over the course I believe this will lead us to be able to help each other explain and execute more complex concepts which will help enhance our pairing abilities in the future.
